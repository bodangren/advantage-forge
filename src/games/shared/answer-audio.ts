/**
 * Read to Select Audio in a game view (F2, measure/tracks/legacy_games_removal_20261006/
 * f2-answer-audio.md). The banner shows the Thai meaning and each choice plays an English word. One
 * clip plays at a time: a touch on a choice plays its clip, and a touch after the clip played to the
 * end confirms the choice. The 🔊 control of a choice only plays it. The host owns the controller
 * (pause, mute, destroy, evidence), so a view calls only this driver.
