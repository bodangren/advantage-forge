/**

 * vocabulary ids, the input id, and the level. The core also accepts the APK `VocabularyInput`,
 * so the APK port can switch this to 'vocabulary'.
 *
 * `requiredAssetBindings` lists the 2D view's files of the `primary-chibi-2d` sprite pack (the key
 * of each binding is its file id); the 3D view loads its models by path until model packs land.
