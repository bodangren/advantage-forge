Style anchors — this is the critical requirement. Every forest asset must look like it belongs to the SAME game as the hamlet set. Two reference images are in `reference/`:
- `reference/forest-quest_001.jpg`: the batch style anchor and layout reference. Match its chunky rounded plant language, its sunny green palette, and its warm fire accent.
- `reference/chibi-quest.png`: the hamlet treatment of the same game. Match its rounded forms, soft bevels, and cheerful palette so forest assets sit beside hamlet assets without a style clash.
They are style guides, not traces: keep geometry simple enough to model with primitives.

Art direction (forest treatment of Chibi Quest): rounded chunky forms, soft bevels everywhere, silhouettes that read at 128 px, and a bright sunny green world with one warm fire accent. Palette contract:
- Grass: sunny leaf green #7ec850, shaded green #4a8a3f.
- Canopy: leaf green #5cb85c, deep green #3f9248.
- Bark and wood: warm brown #8a5a35, dark bark #5f3d22, pale cut wood #c9a06a.
- Stones: cool gray #8a94a0. Dirt: warm tan #c8a86b.
- Ferns and brambles: deep greens #2f7a3f and #4a9a4f.
- Fire (campfire only): flame and ember emissive #ff9a3c at intensity around 2 — the same warm accent contract as the dungeon kit. Never bake brightness into plain paint — light sources must be emissive bodies.
